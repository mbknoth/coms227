# Computer Science 227 - Object-Oriented Programming
Course work from Computer Science 227 at Iowa State University - Completed Spring 2017

This repository is shows the projects I worked on while I was in Com S 227 - I do not condone academic dishonesty or plaguerism.
The intended use for this should just be for a reference and the projects are not the answer key. Going into this class I had no prior experience when it came to programming, and it is nice to see how much I have progressed through my years at Iowa State.
